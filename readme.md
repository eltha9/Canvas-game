# A Canvas project

It's a simple project who show you how endeling mouse selection, and how you can mix **OOP** and **Canvas** 

## features
- Mouse features :
  - selection of the element

- Keyboard features :
  - press _r_ key to reset the position of the elements 
  - press _ctrl+a_ keys (on Windows & Linux devices) or _cmd+a_ keys (on Mac devices)
  - press _esc_ key to unselect the selected elements
  - press _n_  key to create a new element

### Why when you creates new Elements it's sappling's?
An interresting question who need a wonderful response. At the begin I was thinking to do mini rts (real time strategic), but the journey to this project was difficlut. Soo O turn to do this project, and saved some of the work I had done.
Talking about that, if you want to modify the scale of the spallings, you can change it in the ratio of the `tree(x,y,ratio)` method who is the `create()` method of the `BublePeople` class

### ! Warning !
You can only create a maximum of **6000** elements, but if you want to do more you can modifify `maxProp` const in `app.js` script

## What's next ? 
- Next it will be great to keepp going on the initial project.
- Do some improvement 
- think to drop canva, and go on full SVG (I think it's better, and yeah it will be cool with we can have a course about SVG JavaScript manipulation)
